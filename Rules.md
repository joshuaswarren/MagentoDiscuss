Rules
=====

1. The site's domain, hosting information and other login information should be accessible to a hosting committee of at least 3 people, to ensure the site remains active as well as unbiased even if one person becomes disinterested. 

2. The site's domain should not contain the word Magento, to respect Magento's trademark rights. While we are still using the hashtag #MagentoDiscuss, we should consider a new name, such as MageDiscuss, MageCommunity or MageUnity (a combination of Magento and Community). 

3. The site should be completely independent and non-commercial.  It should not be sponsored, funded or hosted by any specific developer, merchant, partner or other commercial entity. There should be no advertising on the site. 

4.  Before the site is launched, there should be a brief statement placed on the site making it clear what the purpose of the site is for and what types of discussions the site was designed to host - i.e., discouraging the posting of discussions that would be better suited for the Magento StackExchange site.
