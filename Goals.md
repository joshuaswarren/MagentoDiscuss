Goals
========
1. To create a single website that the entire Magento community uses as an unofficial gathering place to discuss the needs and desires of the community in an organized manner. 

2. The Magento community means all interested parties - merchants that use Magento, developers that work on Magento, companies that offer systems, services and consulting related to Magento and employees of eBay/Magento. 

3. Everyone is welcome, no matter their opinion or viewpoint. If Magento employees so desire, they should be able to use  this site to determine the concerns and interests of the overall Magento community.

4. This site should remain unbiased, free and open. It should not be sponsored or controlled by any specific interest in the Magento community, and should instead be a completely unofficial community effort. 

5. This site should not replace existing sites, and should not duplicate the effort of existing sites. For instance, users desiring technical help should use the [Magento Stack Exchange site](http://magento.stackexchange.com), and users looking to discuss Magento are encouraged to utilize the [Magento sub-reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/magento). 

6. This site should provide a platform for the entire Magento community to organize themselves into a cohesive voice to express our thoughts, concerns and opinions about Magento to Magento employees.
